# Suicide Rate Analysis

This repository contains a small project for the graduate-level course at the University of Chicago, STAT 37400 Nonparametric Inference. In this project, I analyzed a dataset of the annual suicide rates of 101 countries with their socio-economic information from 1985 to 2016. The programming language is __R__.

The original requirements for this project are provided in `project_requirement.pdf`.

My project report can be viewed in the files `report.pdf` and `report.html`.
